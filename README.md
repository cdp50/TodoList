# Overview

I build my first Kotlin app. My main desire here was to learn how to the Kotlin language works. I was curious how different it would be from building just a webapp. So I build a simple checklist app. An app that takes input from the user and place it right besides a checkbox. You can check the box, uncheck it, and delete the marked boxes from the list.

# Development Environment

In order to accomplish this task I downloaded and learned to use Android Studio. And I also had to learn how to use Recycler View a library that allows to reuse the views and populate them with content. All of this done of course in Kotlin (that was the challenge)
